Movie Recommender System using data from Letterboxd and TMDB.

Different folders contain different parts of the project.

* letterboxd_film_scrapper - has scripts for getting films off Letterboxd.
* predict_film_ratings - has a script for predicting the average rating of a letterboxd film based on scrapped data. Something we briefly explored when we weren't definite that we would get meaningful results for user predictions. Ended up not being used.
* predict_user_rating - has scripts for traning a model to predict a user's rating of a film for a film. Includes code for cross validation.
