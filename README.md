# LetterBoxd Movie Recommnder 
Movie recommender system that uses data from Letterboxd and TMDB.

Different folders contain different parts of the project.

* letterboxd_film_scrapper - has scripts for getting films off Letterboxd.
* predict_film_ratings - has a script for predicting the average rating of a Letterboxd film based on scrapped data. We briefly explored this area when we weren't sure we would get meaningful results for user predictions, but we ended up not using it.
* predict_user_rating - has scripts for training a model to predict a user's rating of a film. Includes code for cross validation.
