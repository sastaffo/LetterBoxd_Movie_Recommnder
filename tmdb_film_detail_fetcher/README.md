# Fetching movie details   

### Description   
This gets film details and test film details for the films from the files in letterbox data (which were retrieved by Philip aka XanthusXX)   

### Run    

**NB: You need a ```keys.py``` file in this directory, with the variable ```TMDB_KEY``` containing your key for the TMDB API.** This has not been uploaded by us due to security reasons    

```
python main.py
```      

Please note that this takes a long time to run, as it waits for 15 to 30 seconds between each API call so as to not spam the API
